     suppleText was not able to create the config.php file that stores your configuration
     information in /st-external/. Please check the following:
     <ul>
          <li>If you are using a linux or unix based system, make sure you
          <code>chmod 755</code> the /st-external/ directory. This usually involves
          right clicking the /st-external/ folder in your FTP client and selecting
          the chmod command. If you have shell access to your account issue the
          following command: <code>chmod 755 /st-external/</code> while in the suppleText
          root directory (where index.php and LICENSE are).</li>
          
          <li>If you are on a windows based system, /st-external/ should already
          have write permissions. Please check that the directory exists.
          Otherwise please contact your host for help.</li>
     </ul>
     <p> 
     Once you have fixed the chmod problem, click back on the browser and try
     the last step again. If you still need help you can always visit the 
     <a href="http://www.suppletext.org/forum">suppleText Support Forums</a>.

     is that the user that you provided to access the database does not have 
     write capabilities (such as using the commands CREATE TABLE and INSERT). 
     Make sure the user has correct permissions. Or it could be that you are
     trying to install the script again and the user already exists.

     just rename st-config.temp.php to st-config.php. Once that occurs, you have
     installed suppleText successfully and there is no need to come back to
     this installer.
